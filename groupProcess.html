    <h3>Group processes and communications</h3>

    <p>
      In the first meeting we agreed a couple of changes to our group processes, outlined in the team profile. In addition, we agreed we would maintain our two meetings a week at the same
      times agreed for Assignment 2 (why change this given we were relatively successful with the delivery of A2). John took over the chair role which has worked well through-out A3.
      It would be fair to say that they communication and through-put within these meetings has been significantly more succinct. A comparison of meeting times between A2 and A3 would be reduced dramatically. <br><br>

      <img src="images/communications/3.jpeg" style="width:100%">  </div> <br><br>
      Given this is an online course and that we are in different geographical area, including metro & regional Victoria, Queensland and Singapore anything but an on- line collaboration
      tool wouldn’t be practical. All meetings are conducted on Teams, generally everyone has their camera’s on, if someone isn’t able to make a meeting they will advise prior to the meeting.
      Due to other commitments, we have the situation where we have had to move a meeting, with this being handled through discussion at prior meetings. <br><br>

      In the prior assignment we had unresponsive team members, this was mainly due to course drop outs, at the time we raised this with our tutor and wouldn’t do things significantly
      different in this assignment. It should be noted that we didn’t have this issue with the current team members in A2 so we are not expecting to have to deal with this during A3.
