    <h3>Group processes and communications</h3>
    <p>The group worked reasonably well together on assignment 2, therefore we didn’t change our processes significantly. <br>

      We have made a couple of changes to our processes based on conversation in our first meeting.  </p>
    <ul class="text">
      <li class="text">    In order to be more involved, certain sections will have contribution across the board rather than being assigned and completed by one person. While this wasn’t anticipated in the Assignment 2 as a major problem in the delivery it was agreed that working as a group to solve each section would give us a greater understanding of the whole and a better learning experience.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="text">
      <li class="text">     Collaborative use of teams for content files, in the previous assignment we worked on documents offline and uploaded .txt files into the git repository. This time around we have set up a main document that we intend to build on as we progress. This enables the team to constantly see the current progress, allows everyone to be aware of the build out of the project plan and hopefully the successful development of a prototype.
      </li>
    </ul>
      <img src="images/communications/2.jpeg" style="width:100%"> <br><br>
    <ul class="text">
      <li class="text">    Despite being newly established, our team has fortunately managed to work harmoniously together and perform reasonably well for Assignment 2. We developed our existing project ideas and got Assignment 3 and 5 moving without hesitation. The team decided to unify our files on Microsoft Teams instead of working individually like what we did in Assignment 2. This simplified our work and made amendments much easier for all the team members. As we are all amateurs in Information Technology, there was a lot of learning taking place within a short timeframe for Assignment 3. However, with the help and contribution of all members, our team has completed the tasks that seemed to be beyond us, especially in making the prototype for our project idea.
