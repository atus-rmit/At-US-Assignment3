    <h1>DrivEase</h1>
  </article>

  <article>
    <br>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <h4>Topic</h4>
    <p>
      With the focus on multi-driver assistance technology, this project deals with the DrivEase design made to lessen the hassle and provide a smoother experience for multi-driver
      vehicles by customizing and storing the drivers’ personal settings such as driving seat’s and mirrors’ positions. Our company will be developing a new software that coproduces
      with Raspberry Pi, the backbone of the world of electronics, to make travel easier and more comfortable.
    </p>

  <h4>Motivation</h4>
  <p>
    Thanks to the rapid evolution of technology, we are now able to reshape the human-machine connections and develop the application of existing technology so that our daily lives’
    limitation can basically be alleviated. As the world’s population grows, the demand for vehicle (car in particular) ownership also increases. This inspires us to design an autonomous system
    that empowers drivers’ journeys.
  </p>

  <h4>Landscape</h4>
  <p>
    Despite the availability of many self-operating devices, there are still limitations and constraints that hinder us from designing self-adjusting seat and mirrors position in vehicles.
    According to Autoblog (“Are Car Seats of the Future Self-Adjusting?”), the new Mercedes-Benz S class already has a driver’s seat with automatically stiffen side bolsters when the vehicle makes
    a tight turn.  <br><br>

Automakers and automotive suppliers are trying to develop automated seat adjustment but it’s still not on the market yet. Some of the newest car models come with blind-spot detection
systems that employ cameras and/or radar to scan behind the vehicle while backing up and the adjacent lanes while driving but most of the old models only have rear and side view mirrors to be adjusted.
Similarly, there is no available devices or technology that offer automation of mirrors adjustment up to this point of time.
  </p>

  <h3>Aims</h3>
  <h4>What will our project do?</h4>

  <p>
    In this project, DrivEase aims to be a universal car accessory which is easily employed and executed by any driver. It is built to facilitate a personalised user experience
    by managing driver’s seat and mirror-position settings so that mental stress and wastage of time can be alleviated. Despite the fact that some newer car versions have self-adjusted seats,
    as far as the current technology can go, such automation is only partially implemented, and when a vehicle is being shared, an individual driver must still go through the manual setting before use. <br><br>

    DrivEase allows drivers to customize their seat and mirror positions on the first usage, i.e. the driver’s seat height, the desired distance from the steering wheel to the seat and
    the positions of mirrors, etc. to optimize their comfort and save them accordingly. All these personalized data can be retrieved afterwards without drivers have to go through
    the settings all over again. Drivers can subsequently edit the initial set up and save it again if there are any desired adjustment(s).
    <br><br>
    It will then store these data according to different individuals and can be retrieved anytime when needed.
  </p>

  <h4>How will we do it?</h4>
  <p>

    Raspberry Pi is the core hardware that DrivEase uses. In scenario that the car has a touchscreen, the car will connect to the DrivEase when it’s plugged into the USB port
    as a device and run the software through the touchscreen on the interior console.
    <br><br>
    In the absence of touchscreen in the interior console, the DrivEase will need a comparable display touchscreen monitor, about five inches for example, or an interface with a mobile app.
    <br><br>
    This interface/app allows the user to select a driver’s profile and settings for the driver seat and side view mirrors, so the seats’ and mirrors’ position can be automatically adjusted.


  </p>

  <h4>How far we have got with developing any features/outcome of the project?</h4>

<p>
  Reflecting on the aim, we set ourselves the task of moving an object with a Raspberry Pi, this was achieved. It was relatively easy; however, the code wouldn’t be particularly useful in a
  real prototype as we would be using the car manufactures systems which are already coded to move the seat or mirrors.

  Given we weren’t able get access to an API we looked to build testing out the potential wiring and the User Interface. We also considered what other feature that we could look to
  incorporate into the overall system. </p>
<h4>Story of our project (how it began, how it has progressed and what stage of the plan we’re up to) </h4>
<p> 1. Initial attempts at programming using python and a RaspberryPi
</p>
<br>

  <img src="images/plan/6.jpg" style="width:100%">   </div>
</main>
<br>
<p>2. Actually getting a servo to move, programmed using code from the internet and wiring maps. Given the time exhausted learning & researching it was decided that time be focused on other aspects. </p> <br><br>

<p>3. We researched car manufactures and whether they had open source API’s however were unable to find any that were available – so building any code that would interact with an API had to be shelved. <br><br>
  <p>
4.We then turned our attention to the user interface.  We designed an interface prototype by using Figma to demonstrate how the functionality of the application will be. <br>  <br>

The interface is planned to look like below:
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br><br>
<p> 5. Additionally we completed some electrical maps of how we believed the device would be wired to a vehicle.

<h3>Difficulties Faced:  </h3>
<p>
  As all of our team members have humble programming backgrounds, Python in particular, and Raspberry Pi, it was indeed a challenge for us to design and create DrivEase’s prototype. In addition to this, we don’t have a thorough understanding the basics of how a car works or the electronics in cars made in the last 20 years, it was tougher to learn about car mechanisms as well as Python from scratch and facing technical difficulties is inevitable.
<br><br>
  We tried making full use of available codes and program logic that we learned from the Introduction to Programming course in Java programming to apply to the design of DrivEase.  However, time is still the main constraint. We encourage more collaboration across the team on the technical part, especially coding. We suggested to combine codes from different members and transfer to our program to test the prototypes or source the existing codes online and customize them to fit our requirements.
  <br><br>
  After the comments and feedbacks, we have gotten from Assignment 2, our group considered getting hardware to move in 4 directions – simulating moving a mirror (and software to facilitate) and to move an object 30 cm’s back and forth (& software to facilitate).

  <h3>Testing</h3>

  <p>
    We will be testing the device as an ongoing part of late-stage development to make sure it meets the size requirements for installation. A prototype will be considered complete once it can be installed into a commercial vehicle and operated by an end-user to adjust the seat and mirror positioning, in a manner that is easier than their normal adjustments. In addition, we will continuously be checking for the logistical requirements of fitting the device into as many vehicles as possible.
<br><br>
Once the software is designed are ready to be tested by the users, a prototype will be prepared, and guerrilla testing will be implemented to obtain user feedbacks. Due to the limited budget and time constraints, guerrilla testing is the most suitable method to obtain feedback.  It is planned that 5-usability test will be conducted at initial stage to outline usability pitfalls.  Once the pitfalls are identified, the software and the interface will be revised accordingly.

    There is a risk of project delivery failure which will result in an inability to deliver on the agreed aim due to:<br>
      A) lack of knowledge and understanding of Python<br>
      B) inexperience using a Raspberry Pi<br>
      C) lack of resources available on-line specific to connecting Rpi to APIs<br>
      D) poorly defined scope and differing views on the interpretation of the scope<br>
      E) lack of motivated members of the team<br>
      F) differences in opinion regarding the specifications of the project.<br><br>

    <h3>Group Processes and Communications</h3><br>
  <br>
    <p> In the first meeting we agreed a couple of changes to our group processes, outlined in the team profile. In addition, we agreed we would maintain our two meetings a week at the same times agreed for Assignment 2 (why change this given we were relatively successful with the delivery of A2). John took over the chair role which has worked well through-out A3. It would be fair to say that they communication and through-put within these meetings has been significantly more succinct. A comparison of meeting times between A2 and A3 would be reduced dramatically.<br>

    Given this is an online course and that we are in different geographical area, including metro & regional Victoria, Queensland and Singapore anything but an on- line collaboration tool wouldn’t be practical. All meetings are conducted on Teams, generally everyone has their camera’s on, if someone isn’t able to make a meeting they will advise prior to the meeting. Due to other commitments, we have the situation where we have had to move a meeting, with this being handled through discussion at prior meetings.<br>

    In the prior assignment we had unresponsive team members, this was mainly due to course drop outs, at the time we raised this with our tutor and wouldn’t do things significantly different in this assignment. It should be noted that we didn’t have this issue with the current team members in A2 so we are not expecting to have to deal with this during A3. </P>
